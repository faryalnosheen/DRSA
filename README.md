# DRSA-Dominance Based Rough Set Approach
In this code, we proposed to compute lower and upper approximations for upward and downward union of classes using heuristic rules
We avoided the computation of dominance relation
We are computing lower and upper approximations for upward/downward union of classes in two parallel threads
First thread computes lower approximation for upward/downward union of classes
Second thread computes upper approximation for upward/downward union of classes
This method considerably reduced the execution time in comparison with conventional DRSA
